# Cooking Manager

Web app to browse and filter family recipes, plan weekly menus, and generate shopping lists. PostgreSQL is the single source of truth (ADR 0022) — the Obsidian vault is disconnected.

Designed for kitchen use on iPad mini 2 (Safari 12.5.8).

**Stage:** the family's cooking app, on a kitchen tablet: 166 recipes, weekly menus,
and a shopping list computed from who is actually at the table (shared custody, holidays,
absences), within everyone's dietary restrictions. Single household; names in the code and tests
are pseudonyms.

Architecture decisions are recorded in [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/) — 44 decision records
(in French), for example: *a cart must be proven before it becomes an order* (0028), *the app owns
the cart and refuses to guess* (0039), *a gate is a recomputed quantifier* (0044).

### Store adapters

The shopping list can be pushed to an online grocery drive. The real store connectors rely on
undocumented APIs and are **not published**: the app talks to them through a small REST contract
(`backend/drive_a.py`: `/health`, `/search`, `/cart`, `/cart/items`, `/order`).
[`backend/fake_drive.py`](backend/fake_drive.py) implements that contract with an in-memory cart
written to a JSON file, so the whole flow runs without any store:

```bash
uvicorn backend.fake_drive:app --port 8120
DRIVE_A_REST_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8120 python -m cooking_manager serve --port 8795
```

## Features

- **Recipe browser** — filter by type, family, tags, dietary constraints; view photos, macros, ingredients, steps
- **Weekly menus** — written straight to the database (`POST /api/menus`), with per-meal recipe linking, photos and covers adjustment
- **Shopping list** — auto-generated from menu recipes × covers, with "remaining items" toggle (filters past days)
- **Dietary compatibility** — checks who's at the table (custody schedule × school holidays × absences) against each person's constraints
- **Voice commands** — speech-to-text (Deepgram) + LLM intent classification (Groq) for hands-free recipe search, servings adjustment, recipe swap, product blacklisting, recipe notes, step editing, meal feedback, and pantry leftovers (Safari 14.5+ only)
- **Table feedback** — record what each person thought of a dish, whether to cook it again, and
  what to fix; a menu is a *plan*, so each meal also carries a **tri-state** `served` (unknown /
  eaten / never cooked). Entered from the iPad, no `curl` required
- **Dietary preferences** — a third tier between hard bans and dislikes: minimize, maximize, cap
  (with value, unit and scope), rotate, no-restriction. They **weigh without blocking**: the menu
  compatibility endpoint counts them and reports `preferences_breached` — plus
  `preferences_unmeasurable`, because a rule whose target no ingredient carries, or a `cap` in
  grams counted in meals, reports a zero that measures nothing (ADR 0023)
- **Effort bands** — every dish is read from its *steps*, not its clock: `hands_off`,
  `light_hands_on`, `hands_on`, `project`. A 50-minute stew leaves your hands free; a 35-minute
  risotto does not. Weeknight dinners that do not fit are listed (ADR 0024)
- **Pantry management** — track what's in stock, mark leftovers
- **Cookbook import** — photograph a printed recipe page; a vision model transcribes it, the
  house parser structures the ingredients, and the draft is **reviewed before** it is written to
  the database. Nothing is written until you validate it.
- **Computed macros** — totals derived from the parsed ingredients, combining three sources by
  precedence (verified brand sheet › drive product label › ANSES CIQUAL generic). Reports its
  own **coverage**: a partial sum is never presented as a recipe total.

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Backend | FastAPI + asyncpg |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS SPA — zero build, static files served by FastAPI |
| Database | PostgreSQL (`postgresql-shared` Docker container) |
| Voice | Deepgram (STT) + Groq LLM (intent) |

## Setup

```bash
# Prerequisites: Python 3.12+, PostgreSQL (or Docker postgresql-shared)

# Install
pip install .

# Run
python -m cooking_manager serve --port 8795

# Re-link menu meals to recipes (reads nothing from disk since ADR 0022)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8795/api/ingest
```

Environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL DSN (`postgresql://cooking:...@localhost/cooking_manager`) |
| `VAULT_ROOT` | No | Legacy — still set in the systemd unit, read by nothing since ADR 0022 |
| `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` | For voice | Deepgram STT API key |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | For voice | Groq LLM API key |

## Data Source

**PostgreSQL only** (ADR 0022). Recipes, menus, people, pantry and shopping all live in the
database; nothing is read from the Obsidian vault.

| Table | Content |
|---|---|
| `recipe` / `recipe_ingredient` / `recipe_step` | Recipes, written by `POST /api/recipes` |
| `menu` / `menu_meal` | Weekly menus, written by `POST /api/menus` |
| `person` / `household_member` | Dietary profiles, and who is a resident of the household |
| `pantry_item` / `pantry_alias` | Pantry stock |
| `shopping_preference` | Products and brands refused at purchase |

`POST /api/ingest` no longer reads the filesystem: it re-links `menu_meal` rows to their recipes.

## API

### Menus
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/menus` | List menus |
| POST | `/api/menus` | Create a menu |
| DELETE | `/api/menus/{slug}` | Delete a menu |

| GET | `/api/menus/{slug}/compatibility` | Dietary check on **ingredients**, per meal — conflicts (each with `membership` and `repaired`), engine `repairs`, `unrepaired`, `preferences`, `meals_without_protein` (chacun avec `secondary` — l'apport protéique hors rotation), `weeknight_too_heavy` |
| GET | `/api/menus/{slug}/shopping-list` | Generate shopping list (`?covers=N&from_date=YYYY-MM-DD`) — each line carries `outcome`, `merged_from` and `purchase` (measured / countable / dose / unresolved) ; read `pantry.confirmation` before `lines` |
| POST | `/api/menus/{slug}/pantry-confirm` | Confront the pantry before a cart goes out — `lines` (confirmed / corrected / absent) or `blind: true` with its `reason` |

### Shopping
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/shopping/validate-cart` | Confront a cart with refused products **and the pantry confirmation** — `menu_slug` is required, `ok:false` blocks checkout (read `pantry` for the reason) |
| POST | `/api/shopping/import` | Import a shopping session |

| POST | `/api/pantry/items` | Add a pantry item |
| GET | `/api/pantry/items/{id}` | Item detail |
| PUT | `/api/pantry/items/{id}` | Update item (status, qty, notes) |
| DELETE | `/api/pantry/items/{id}` | Remove item |
| GET | `/api/pantry/search?q=` | Search items by name |
| POST | `/api/pantry/leftover` | Mark a pantry item as leftover — `quantity` must carry a value and a unit |
| PATCH | `/api/pantry` | Update an item **by name** — 409 on homonyms, use `PUT /items/{id}` |

### Food reference (no frontend — curl, MCP or script)
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/food` | List foods with their macro-form count (`?q=` filters) |
| POST | `/api/food` | Create a food (key derived from the name when omitted) |
| GET | `/api/food/{key}` | Food detail: forms + linked products |
| PUT | `/api/food/{key}` | Update a food |
| DELETE | `/api/food/{key}` | Delete a food — forms cascade, products are detached |
| GET | `/api/food/{key}/form` | List a food's macro forms |
| POST | `/api/food/{key}/form` | Upsert a form — `(food_key, label)` is the key |
| DELETE | `/api/food/{key}/form/{label}` | Remove one form |
| GET | `/api/product` | List products (`?q=`, `?unlinked=true`) |
| PATCH | `/api/product/{id}` | Link `food_key`, fix name/brand/nature/status |

Macros live in `food_form`, one row per form (`lentille` × `crues`/`cuites`) — never in `food`.
Three explicit refusals rather than a silent success: unknown `status` → **422**, unknown
`food_key` → **404**, linking a `composite` product → **422** (a composite carries its own
macros, ADR 0016).

### Other
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/ingest` | Re-link `menu_meal` rows to their recipes (reads no file since ADR 0022) |
| GET | `/api/stats` | Dashboard stats |
| GET | `/health` | Health check |

## Browser Compatibility

The frontend targets **Safari 12.5.8** (iPad mini 2 used in the kitchen). The iOS 12 compatibility gate is enforced on every commit touching `web/`. Voice features require Safari 14.5+ and are hidden on older browsers.
